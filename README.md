Code and answers for online courses I've taken since August 2014

IN PROGRESS  
    
Design of Computer Programs - Udacity  
 -Great Python course from Peter Norvig (Google), highly recommended

Data Analysis with R - Udacity  
 -Essentially an introduction to RStudio and a course on ggplot(2),
  both of which I'd hardly used before. Sponsored by Facebook

Software Testing - Udacity  
 -##software ## tools
  
<br>  
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-Each course has a separate directory which contains all of the code
 and answers for all of the course questions and problem sets  
 -Optional/unmarked questions & problem sets are included but I leave
 out some of the more trivial answers to lesson questions
